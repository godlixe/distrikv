## Yet Another Key-Value Store

This is work in progress of a distributed LSM-Tree based key-value store. distrikv is probably the name for this project.

- Stores key-value data
- Distributed (hopefully possible)

TODOs:
- [x] Stores and queries data in-memory
- [x] Stores and queries data from files
- [x] Properly compact SST
- [x] Restructure SST Format
- [ ] Refine logging
- [x] Add REST API
